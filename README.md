This is the culminating project for Ali Wadee's ICS3U class made by Thomas Kidd and Misha Zharov. In order to run this you can clone the repository and build the project in your IDE of choice. The "res" folder should be in the same directory that the .jar file is in.

The easiest way to make this run is to install Eclipse and to "File > Import > Git > Projects from Git > Clone URI". In the next step the URI should be "https://bitbucket.org/USBquantumState/nuclear.git". If you would like to look at the commits and the line by line change history you can go to "https://bitbucket.org/USBquantumState/nuclear" and visit the "Source" and "Commits" tabs.

In the repository you will find the code under /Nuclear/src/ and the images used under /Nuclear/res/. Also there are JavaDocs under /Nuclear/JavaDocs. These are HTML files and can be viewed in your browser.

Please use at least Java 7 to run this code, even better if you can use Java 8. The screen resolution should not matter, but it was extensively tested on 1360 x 768 and 1024 x 768 screen resolutions, so using these would be preferred.
